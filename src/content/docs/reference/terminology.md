## Supply Chain Attack

A software **supply chain attack** occurs when attackers infiltrate the
development or distribution process of software to insert malicious code into
legitimate software packages or updates. This type of _cyber attack_ exploits the
trust relationship between software vendors and their customers, aiming to
compromise user systems or steal data when the tainted software is deployed or
updated.

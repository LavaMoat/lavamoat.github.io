## Troubleshooting resources

### Policy configuration

If the result of running automated policy generation is not enough to correctly run your application, remember to put changes you want to manually make in the policy in the `policy-override.json` file and avoid your changes being overwritten when you regenerate policy

#### When I regenerate policy, package keys in `resources` change

The keys in the resources field (we refer to them as canonical names for packages) are the shortest paths through the dependency tree pointing to a package.
We could not use names because it's possible for multiple entirely different packages to have the same name (see the intro video on the main page to learn how).

When you make changes to your dependency tree it's possible that a new, shorter path to a dependency was introduced and that will affect what it's called as a result.
The algorithm for creating canonical names is designed to make them as stable as possible, but they can change and you may sometimes need to update the keys in `policy-override.json` to match.

### Error codes beginngin with `SES_`

If you get an error beginning with `SES_` - look it up in the collection of documents here: https://github.com/endojs/endo/tree/master/packages/ses/error-codes

### SES lockdown related issues

For troubleshooting interactions with SES->lockdown you should be aware that LavaMoat is passing the folowing configuration to lockdown:

```js
const lockdownOptions = {
  // gives a semi-high resolution timer
  dateTaming: 'unsafe',
  // this is introduces non-determinism, but is otherwise safe
  mathTaming: 'unsafe',
  // lets code observe call stack, but easier debuggability
  errorTaming: 'unsafe',
  // shows the full call stack
  stackFiltering: 'verbose',
  // prevents most common override mistake cases from tripping up users
  overrideTaming: 'severe',
  // preserves JS locale methods, to avoid confusing users
  // prevents aliasing: toLocaleString() to toString(), etc
  localeTaming: 'unsafe',
};
```

Detailed documentation of `lockdown`: https://github.com/endojs/endo/blob/master/packages/ses/docs/reference.md

#### TypeError: Cannot assign to read only property...

If you get an error like that, it means there was an attempt to assign to one fo the frozen global prototypes.
While overrideTaming is enabled, some override mistakes are still possible, so if the assignment looks like it's assigning to a regular object, be aware that the error might be caused by the prototype of that object being frozen.
See the video above for detailed examples.

#### Troublesome packages

If a package is having trouble working in a locked-down environment, it's either on the list here: https://github.com/endojs/endo/issues/2037 or is worth reporting.
The issue contains links to fixes you can introduce.

### Patching packages locally

When a package has a compatibility issue, you can patch it locally before/instad of fixing upstream.

`patch-package` is a tool used to make and maintain fixes to npm dependencies. To use patch-package with npm, you first install it as a development dependency using `npm install patch-package --save-dev`. After making the necessary changes to the files in the `node_modules/PROBLEMATIC_PACKAGE` directory, you run `npx patch-package PROBLEMATIC_PACKAGE` to create a patch file in the `patches` directory. This patch file should be committed to your version control system. Now you need to call `npx patch-package` after each clean install (can be automated).

Yarn Berry has a built-in feature called `yarn patch` that allows you to patch packages directly. To use this feature, you run `yarn patch PROBLEMATIC_PACKAGE`, which creates a temporary directory where you can make your changes. After editing, you run `yarn patch-commit` to generate a `.yarn/patches` file. This patch file is then referenced in your `package.json` under the `resolutions` field. Yarn's patching mechanism is more restrictive in handling versions, ensuring that the patches are applied only to the specified versions of the packages. This built-in feature is very restrictive to versions, so will require more work to update the patches, while patch-package offers more flexibility but requires additional setup.
